      "title": "Day 13 - Goa Travel",
      "content": "Today was a travel day again—this time a vacation within the vacation. We made our way to the beaches of Goa, and the shift in energy was immediate. The last few days had been full in the best way, but still busy: movement, people, transitions, noise. Today marked the moment where things finally softened. The bags were set down. The pace slowed. There's space now to actually rest. Proper R&R."

    {
      "title": "Day 14 - Steady but Heavy",
      "content": "Today was one of those steady-but-heavy days. A lot moved, even if none of it felt flashy. Loose ends tightened. Decisions that had been hovering finally landed. There was some resistance too — the kind that doesn't stop progress, just slows it down enough to make you feel every step. The energy wasn't rushed. It was deliberate. Less about pushing forward at all costs and more about staying with what's actually here, even when it's inconvenient."
    },
    {
      "title": "Day 23 - Back to Work",
      "content": "Back to work today. That familiar moment where the calendar says 'go,' but the body and brain are still shaking off the dust from time away. Nothing dramatic happened, but a lot quietly snapped back into place. I opened the tabs, reviewed what was in motion, and resisted the urge to sprint just to prove I was productive again. The routine didn't feel automatic yet, but it felt available. There was a low hum of resistance early on, the kind that shows up when momentum hasn't caught up to intention."
