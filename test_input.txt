Today was focused on building momentum with the ZABAL automation system. Spent the morning setting up the infrastructure for the newsletter bot - integrating OpenAI's API to handle both the daily reflections and social content generation. The goal is to streamline the entire workflow so creating content becomes effortless.

There's something clarifying about building tools that serve your own creative process. Not chasing features for the sake of it, just solving real friction points. The system is coming together piece by piece - newsletter generation, social posts for every platform, all from a single command.

Still need to integrate the Paragraph API for publishing, but that's next. For now, the foundation is solid.
